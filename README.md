## üí° About Hive Helsinki

Hive Helsinki is a coding school in Finland, inspired by the educational model of the French school Ecole 42. At Hive, traditional teaching methods like lectures, teachers, and textbooks are replaced with collaborative learning and hands-on project work. Students learn coding by working together on practical and real-life projects.

You can find more information about Hive and 42 on the [Hive official website](https://www.hive.fi/en/) and [42 official website](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).
